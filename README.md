Refactor and CI Assignment

Due Date: Wednesday, 11:59pm
Total Points: 100
Introduction

For this assignment, you can choose from one of the two provided homework assignments from CS132. Each file contains several asserts, which serve as test cases. Additionally, these files also include sample codes that validate the correctness of the classes implemented.
Assignment Files:

    cs132_HW1.py
    assignment-lists-solutions.py

(Replace "link_to_filename" with the actual download link or path for each file.)
Objectives

Your main task is to refactor the chosen assignment into a structured Python package. Below are the detailed steps you need to follow:

    GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository, either public or private. If you choose a private repository, ensure you add "wagenhoffer" as a collaborator.

    Build System: Set up a build system using tools like Poetry, setuptools, and others.

    Code Refactoring: Refactor the provided code into source (src) files and corresponding test files.

    Testing: Make sure all the code passes the tests using testing frameworks such as Pytest, PyUnit, or Doctest.

    Linting: Ensure your code's quality and adherence to Python standards by running a linter. Recommended tools include Flake8, Black, Pylama, etc.

    Coverage Report: Generate a coverage report to determine how much of your code is covered by tests.

    Continuous Integration (CI): Set up a CI system that automatically triggers and runs tests, linter, and coverage report on every code push to your repository.

    Submission: Submit the link to your GitHub repository for grading.

Note:

If Python isn't your preferred language, alternative assignments in Racket or Julia can be provided upon request. Please reach out if you'd like one of these options.
